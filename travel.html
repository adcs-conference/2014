<h1>Travel Awards for Students Presenting at ADCS 2014</h1>

<p>The Conference is offering travel support to students coming to
ADCS2014 in Melbourne.  These awards can be put toward travel and
accommodation expenses.  While we expect that there will be four
awards of approximately A$500 each, the organising committee reserves
the right to award more or less awards as they see fit, or to alter
the amount of any awards.</p>

<h3>Students: How to apply</h3>

<ul>
<li>Send an email to the general chair of the conference (Falk
Scholer, <a href="mailto:falk.scholer@rmit.edu.au">falk.scholer@rmit.edu.au</a>)
with the subject line "ADCS 2014 Travel Support Request",
indicating that you would like to apply for the award, and the amount
for which you are applying.</li>
<li>The email <em>must</em> be cc'ed to your
supervisor.</li>
<li>In the email, you should briefly outline why you should
get the award.  Please address the selection criteria below
(bullet points are fine).  Be sure to include your name, your supervisor's
name, and where you will be travelling from.</li>

<li>You must also arrange for your supervisor to send a separate email
acknowledging that you are indeed enrolled as a student, and that the
statements you made in the application are correct (to the best of
their knowledge).</li>

</ul>

<p><em>Note that the award will be in the form of a reimbursement of
expenses, not a cash award</em>. The awardees will only receive money
after producing receipts for appropriate expenses, and completing any
supplied forms. The reimbursement will be processed through RMIT accounts
or the ACM.</p>

<h3>Selection Criteria</h3>

<p>Applications will be selected according to the following
criteria.</p>

<p>Essential:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The student is presenting a paper at ADCS2014.</li>
<!--  (You can apply
  for an award before paper decisions are announced, as long as you
  have submitted a paper; and as long as you will be presenting it, if
  the paper is accepted.) -->
  <li>The student's host university and/or supervisor is unable to
  fund (or fully fund) the travel.</li>
  <li>The student will stay in cheap accommodation during the
  conference.</li>
</ol>
