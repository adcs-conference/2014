<h1>Paper Guidelines</h1>


<!--
<p>(Please note that the deadline for submissions has passed.)</p>
-->

<p>
Please use the Latex or Word template files which are available on the
<a href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates">
ACM templates page</a>.
</p>

<p>Submissions of full-length papers should be a maximum of eight pages in 
the required style (approximately 3000 words).</p>

<p>Submissions for Posters,
Short papers, Industry Status Reports, and Demonstrations (if any of
the above) should be a maximum of four pages in
the required style (appoximately 1500 words).</p>

<p>All submitted papers should include abstract, keywords and should
apply ACM Computing Classification categories and terms. The templates
provide space for this indexing and point authors to the 
<a href="http://www.acm.org/about/class/1998">Computing
Classification Scheme</a>.
</p>

<p>All submissions must be original work, not previously published 
elsewhere, and not currently submitted to any other conference or
journal.</p>

<p>Submissions that differ markedly in length or style from these
guidelines risk being rejected without further consideration.</p>


<h1>Poster Instructions</h1>

<p>
Posters should be A0 (portrait orientation only) or A1 (portrait or landscape) size.
</p>

<p>
Please note that there are no poster printing facilities at the conference venue. However, if you don't want to travel with your poster, there are professional printing services nearby (for example, <a href="http://www.dinkums.com.au/">Dinkums</a> on Swanston St) but these will of course charge you a fee.
