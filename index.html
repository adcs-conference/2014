<h3>Submissions</h3>

<p> Submissions should comply with
the <a href="paperguide.html">paper guidelines</a>.  All submissions
must be original work, not previously published elsewhere, and not
currently submitted to any other conference or journal.</p>

<p><b>Submission of a paper should be regarded as an undertaking
that, should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will
attend the symposium to present the work.</b> Note also that it is
insufficient for an author to register and pay for the symposium to
be regarded as fulfilling this obligation.</p>

<p><b>Submission for ADCS 2014 has closed.</b></p>

<h4>Full papers</h4>

<p>Full papers should describe new contributions or analyse research
issues.  Submissions should be at most eight pages long (around 3000 words); 
over-length submissions risk immediate rejection.  Refer to
the <a href="paperguide.html">guidelines for papers</a> for details of
the required format.</p>

<h4>Posters, short papers and industry status reports</h4>

<p>To encourage participation by industry and to provide a place for
work of a more speculative nature, ADCS invites submissions for short
papers, up to a maximum of four pages (around 1500 words).  
A typical proposal might
describe a leading-edge solution to a practical problem in document
management or search.  Short papers should follow the same format as for full papers.</p>

<p>Presentation of short papers will be via a poster session.
Accepted short papers will also be included in a separate section of
the symposium proceedings.</p>

<!--
<h4>
<font face="Georgia"><font color="#000099">Student Posters</font></font></h4>
We also encourage student to submit a one to two page summary of their
recent or proposed work to be presented as a speed talk (1 or 2 minutes)
and a poster. Students who take up this option will receive a discount on their registration fee.
-->

<!--
<h4>Demonstrations</h4>

<p>If you would like to give a demonstration of your system, please
submit an abstract following the same format as for short papers.
Demonstrations should be self-contained, and only limited hardware
support will be available at the venue.</p>

-->

<h4>Proceedings</h4>

<p>
The <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2682862">ADCS 2014 proceedings</a> are now available through the ACM digital library.
<!--
The conference proceedings will be published online in the
<a href="http://dl.acm.org">ACM Digital Library</a>.
All submissions will be fully refereed by a blind refereeing process,
at their full published length, and will comply with DEST criteria for
fully-refereed conference papers (category F1).
